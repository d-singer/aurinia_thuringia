# R scripts

The provided R-code can be used to reproduce the results of the paper, however it can also be adapted for use with own data. 

## 01_prepare_data_and_basic_results.R

This script prepares the data for all following analyses and provides a basal descriptive analysis of the raw capture data (Figure 1). 

## 02_recapture_distances.R

This script calculates the recapture flight distances and analyses differences in flight distances between males and females (Figure 2).

## 03_maps_aurinia.R

This script prepares the data for the following visualisation of capture densities and recapture connections in ggplot-maps for Hainich and Kriegberg (Figure 3). 

## 04_population_models_HAINICH.R

This script models populations sizes based on the recapture data for the Hainich study site, including weather parameters (Table 1).  

## 05_population_models_KRIEGBERG.R

This script models populations size based on the recapture data for the Kriegberg study site, including weather parameters (Table 1).
